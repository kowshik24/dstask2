# dstask2(en_core_web_sm)

1. "en_core_web_sm" is a pre-trained statistical model for English language processing that is provided by the spaCy library. It is a relatively small model, but it still performs well on a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, and dependency parsing.
2. I have use "en_core_web_sm" because it provides a good balance between accuracy and speed. It is a smaller model than some of the larger models available, which makes it faster to load and process text. However, it still provides a high level of accuracy for many NLP tasks.

3. Another advantage of "en_core_web_sm" is that it has been trained on a large amount of data, which makes it more robust and accurate than models trained on smaller datasets.

4. Overall, "en_core_web_sm" is a good choice for many NLP tasks because of its speed, accuracy, and robustness.
